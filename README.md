# YT Playlist Manager
The idea of this application is to allow users to have more options of controlling, managing, editing and sorting their YT playlist than what YT provides.

## The roadmap
- Add login via Google/YT Account
- Show playlists of a user
- Add nice component library with beautiful UI
- Edit playlists (name, description, etc)
- Manage user account - change data, download data, remove data
- Sort playlist by:
  - default options  
  - video length
- Add scheduled sorting
- Remove duplicates
- Remove deleted videos
- Remove unavailable videos in your region
- Get suggestions on what to watch next
